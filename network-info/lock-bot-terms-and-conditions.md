# Terms & Conditions

## Server Responsibility

Lock bot does not take any responsibility for any commands run in a server by a user to preform a function that may cause damage or expose information. This includes maintenance mode and other commands of that nature, please read all notices and documentation before using a command.

We are not responsible for any users in a server with permissions to use commands, commands have been given permission levels to suit most server setups. Consider reading up on the commands and the admin and mod system before using lock bot.

## Uptime

Lock bot is a non profit project payed for and run by the developers and supported by our sponsors, please do not expect rapid service 100% of the time we try our hardest to keep the bot running at peak efficiency, but please remember we all have lives as well and  we dont get much out of this project we run it for the community.

## Support & Discord

Support in the discord and on the websites are completely voluntary, no one is getting paid for this so dont expect constant support but we will once again do our best to provide support for the service. Staff have the right to refuse help to any member for any reason.   

## Who reads this stuff anyway?

Who even reads terms and conditions anyway? What are you doing here go and have fun!  
No seriously, we are very laid back here at lock bot so just get out there, hope our bot helps you :\)
