While inviting LockBot into your server, you accept that LockBot can store data (like the guild ID and member count). We collect this information to identify users that exploit, abuse or are genuinely throwing errors in LockBot's terminal in any way.

The Discord and Developer TOS apply as well. It goes without saying that this bot and its use (by anybody who invokes commands with it) is subject to the Discord Terms of Service and the Discord Developer Terms of Service.

## What data we collect

We only store your server data (Server ID) in our database to make sure everything is saved in case of a bot restart and to keep things running smoothly as possible.

When adding LockBot to your server, LockBot will automatically store your Server ID in our database.&#x20;

In some cases, LockBot might use some sensitive information.

For example: The `suggest`command will collect and send data to our Support Server where we can review your suggestion. We include, Server Name, Server ID, Member Count, Region, Random Server Invite, Bot Join Date, Server Shard. Only the LockBot Staff can view this, you are allowed to request that information to be deleted from our server if you wish.

### What data we DO NOT collect

For total privacy and confidentiality, we do not collect sensitive information about your server, for example: invite URL, member count, messages, attachments etc.

## Support & Discord

Support in the Discord and on the websites are completely voluntary, no one is getting paid for it. Staff will try their best to provide regular support but due to the geographical location of our staff, we may not always have one online. Staff have the right to refuse help to any member for any reason.

## Uptime

Lock Bot is a non profit project paid for and run by the developers and supported by our partners please do not expect rapid service 100% of the time we try our hardest to keep the bot running at peak efficiency, but please remember we all have lives as well and we don't get much out of this project; we run it for the community.

## Server Responsibility

Lock Bot does not take any responsibility for any commands run in a server by a user to preform a function that may cause damage or expose information. This includes maintenance mode and other locking commands of that nature, please read all notices and documentation before using a command.
