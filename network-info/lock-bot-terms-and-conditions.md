# Terms & Conditions + Privacy Policy

This application is held under the 'Modified BSD License'. Please read these terms and conditions completely, before using Lock Bot on your server, which is owned and operated by Adam\_V, the Lock Bot staff, and developers.

Lock Bot is developed and maintained by Adam\_V and Miguel\_ who of which own the bot and all the assets related to the project. The terms and conditions are governed in accordance with the laws of the United States, particularly California. Discord ToS will always be enforced when using the bot.

These terms and conditions will outline what our service is, what we do with it, and what that means for you.

Adam\_V and the Lock Bot Staff reserve the right to terminate your access to the bot, without any advance notice. These terms were updated on **21 December 2021**.

## Legal

Although Lock Bot is entirely private and closed source, we will not allow any redistribution of code, logos, branding, or any asset related to the project or bot. We reserve the right to take legal actions if one of the actions above are present, which will also include DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) take down requests. We reserve the right to alter, change, replace, and terminate the usage of this document at any time.

## Inviting and Using Lock Bot

While using and inviting Lock Bot to your server, you accept the following terms below as well as the Terms of Service listed [here](https://docs.lockbot.dev/network-info/terms-of-service).&#x20;

## What data do we collect?

Lock Bot does not store any data labelled as "personal," however, Lock Bot does store:

* **Server ID**: automatically added to database upon bot joining server for other actions.
* **Guild/Server Channel Permissions:** necessary to ensure your channel permissions are restored after certain commands are used.&#x20;
* **User ID:** this is only for those occasional bad apples we spot and don't want ruining this project for others.
* **Anti Scam Triggers:** populates the figures of triggers and punishments received.

In some cases, Lock Bot may scan and read all channels, which only includes links, as it's a necessary function for the anti-scam module to properly determine if a link or file sent is malicious or can harm users. Messages will never be logged internally or externally as your server should remain private.

## What data isn't collected?

As previously mentioned, we don't store any data labelled as "personal," so that means we'll never collect your:

* Email Address
* IP Address
* Invite URL
* Messages and/or Attachments

We plan to keep it this way as it should be as your privacy and safety will always be our #1 concern. However, in the future (and currently however not recommended as of now since it will alter the databases in a negative way) to evolve our service you will have the right to have your data in our databases deleted as required upon request under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and will be used as a general privacy practice in our services.&#x20;

## The Legal Stuff

The Discord and Developer Terms of Service apply as well. It goes without saying that this bot and its use (by anybody who invokes commands with it) is subject to the Discord Terms of Service and the Discord Developer Terms of Service.

## Support & Discord

Support offered in our server and website are completely voluntary and up to staff member on their willingness to help.&#x20;

## Uptime

Lock Bot was a non-profit project, however due to rising costs we've opened a Patreon and accept donations. Whilst this project is still being ran to the best of it's abilities, uptime and reliability will rapidly change at any given moment. It's something we wish to avoid although sometimes it's inevitable.&#x20;

## Server Responsibility

Lock Bot and it's Staff Members do not take any responsibility for any commands run in a server by a user to perform a function that may cause damage or expose information. This includes commands deemed as dangerous like Maintenance Mode or Ban Lock.&#x20;
