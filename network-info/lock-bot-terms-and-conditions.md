# Terms & Conditions

## Server Responsibility

LockBot does not take any responsibility for any commands run in a server by a user to perform a function that may cause damage or expose information. This includes using commands such as maintenance mode and other commands of that nature. Please read all notices and documentation before using a command.

We are not responsible for any users in a server with permissions to use commands, commands have been given permission levels to suit most server setups. Consider reading up on the commands before using LockBot.

## Uptime

LockBot is a non-profit project paid for and run by the developers and supported by our sponsors so please do not expect fast service 100% of the time. We try our hardest to keep the bot running at peak efficiency, but please remember we all have commitments outside of the project and we don't get a lot out of it; we run it for the community.

## Support & Discord

Support in the Discord and on the websites are completely voluntary, no one is getting paid for this. Staff will try their best to provide regular support but due to the geographical location of our staff, we may not always have one online. Staff have the right to refuse help to any member for any reason.

## Who reads this stuff anyway?

If you are actually reading this then I congratulate you! If you are reasonable with LockBot then it will be reasonable with you and we are sure that you will have no problems. :\)
