# Terms of Service

Here at Lock Bot we strive to provide the most reliable and dependable server raid-prevention, scam and utility bot, however, this can't go without rules because rules are what make the world go around! Anarchy isn't exactly our cup-of-tea but let's jump into it:

## Lock Bot Terms of Service

* Using Lock Bot for any activity that can be legally deemed as "illegal" is prohibited at all costs and will result in your being blacklisted from interacting with or using our bot.
* Intentionally launching attacks (such as DDoS and spam messages) or attempting to bring the bot offline which harms it or the services running the bot will result in your immediate blacklist from the bot. Bugs may be reproduced to show developers and staff issues, however abusing bugs or vulnerabilities will never be allowed.&#x20;
* Reports on ToS violations will be reviewed and acted upon if neccesary depending on the severity. Manangement members reserve the right to blacklist any individuals for any valid reason.
* We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.
* We reserve the right to update these Terms, which we may do for reasons that include, but are not limited to, complying with changes we've made to the bot and/or changes to enhance this document.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Following these terms are essential, otherwise you could be blacklisted from our&#x20;

network and from using the bot! It's only fair.
