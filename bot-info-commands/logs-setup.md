# Logs Setup

## Set Logs

By default, logging will not be enabled on the server. Once you enable the logs \(by setting a logs channel\) you will be able to get command logs from the locking and moderation commands. ~~You can also enable user join logs and message logging as a separate feature later on.~~

{% hint style="success" %}
**Format: \[prefix\]Setlogs \#channel**

**User permissions required: server owner / server admin**

**Bot permissions required: none** â€“ _It's advised that lock bot should have full server admin to carry out functions correctly._
{% endhint %}
