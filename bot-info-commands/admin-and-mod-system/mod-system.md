# Mod System

## Moderator System

For more general information about the general system itself see the Admin & Mod System general page. The moderator role itself will give access to lower commands than the admin role and is designed for general staff and low level moderators. This role \(if enabled\) will give users assigned to it access to all the commands under the moderation category and some in the general commands category such as the embed command.

This role should not be given to people that should not have access to the above commands.

Users with this role will not be able to use any locking commands.
