# Prefix Setup

## Server Prefix

A bot prefix is a symbol or letter that goes before a command to tell the bot that it is required to do something, by default the prefix is **.**

## Lost / Unknown Prefix

If you have lost your prefix or you are confused on what it could be, simply tag the bot and it will tell you what your current set prefix for the server is.

## Changing Server Prefix

Some users do not like the default prefix and / or want to change it to something else to make it easier and work better in that server, we do allow users to change there prefix using the following command.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Format: \[current prefix\]Prefix \[New Prefix\]**

**User permissions required: server owner / server admin**

**Bot permissions required: none** â€“ _It's advised that lock bot should have full server admin to carry out functions correctly._
{% endhint %}

Because this feature takes up storage space on our server, it is a requirement for users that wish to change the prefix have voted for our bot page in return. You can find our page here: [_https://top.gg/bot/422082687310888971_](https://top.gg/bot/422082687310888971)\_\_
