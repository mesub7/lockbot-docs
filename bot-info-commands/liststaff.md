# List Staff

Want to see who's a Lock Bot mod/admin and who isn't? We've got a command for that:

{% hint style="success" %}
**Format: \[prefix\]liststaff**

**User permissions required: everyone**

**Bot permissions required: none** â€“ _It's advised that lock bot should have full server admin to carry out functions correctly._
{% endhint %}

This command will list the Lock bot added moderator and admins \(if the system is enabled\). Note: users that do not have the role will not be shown on the list but may still be able to run the command if they have sufficient role permissions.

![An example of the liststaff command](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

If the system has not been set up and the command has been attempted to be run then an error message will be displayed.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If this command is run in the official discord server then it will list the official staff members. Any user claiming to be staff that is not should be reported to the Lock bot team.
{% endhint %}
