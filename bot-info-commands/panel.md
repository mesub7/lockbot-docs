# Panel

Ah yes, the panel that has all the information. It's a bit like the control panel but you use commands to toggle the switches :'\).

{% hint style="success" %}
**Format: \[prefix\]panel**

**User permissions required: none**

**Bot permissions required: None** â€“ _It's advised that lock bot should have full server admin to carry out functions correctly._
{% endhint %}
