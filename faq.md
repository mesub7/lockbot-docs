# FAQ

## Why is Lock Bot shutting down?

We are sorry to say that Lock Bot will be shutting down. This is for many reasons including the developer's time to work on the project.

### But it could be open source, no?

We discussed making open source but decided against it just due to the things that are linked with our servers and commands that are broken including the fact that it will need to be updated to discord js v12. We do hope that lock bot has inspired developers to take on projects in such an area.



## What is the bot prefix / Why is it not working?

The bot's prefix is **.** \(Yes it has been changed :\) \). \_\_If the main prefix is still not working for you and it may have been changed but you don't know what it would be, tag the bot and it will show you your current server prefix.

**Can I change the prefix I don't like the default one?**

Yes: you can find out more below.

## How do I become staff?

We currently are not looking for staff members right now. However, we do have an opportunity to help us out in the discord server. Please DM mesub\#0556 for more information.

## Does Lock Bot actually prevent raids?

Lock Bot can be used as part of a server management kit to help prevent raids. This includes using [Discord's security verification levels](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/216679607-What-are-Verification-Levels-) as well as using another bot for verification. Depending on how many measures you have put in place, Lock Bot can be your second or third \(last\) form of defence if a raid occurs.
