# FAQ

## What is the bot prefix / Why is it not working?

The bot's prefix is **.** \(Yes it has been changed :\) \). \_\_If the main prefix is still not working for you and it may have been changed but you don't know what it would be, tag the bot and it will show you your current server prefix.

**Can I change the prefix I don't like the default one?**

Yes: you can find out more below.

## How do I become staff?

We currently are not looking for staff members right now. However, we do have an opportunity to help us out in the discord server. Please DM mesub\#0556 for more information.

## Does Lock Bot actually prevent raids?

Lock Bot can be used as part of a server management kit to help prevent raids. This includes using [Discord's security verification levels](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/216679607-What-are-Verification-Levels-) as well as using another bot for verification. Depending on how many measures you have put in place, Lock Bot can be your second or third \(last\) form of defense if a raid occurs.
