# FAQ

We aim for a **beta** release on January 1 2021.

## Where has "x" command gone?

We continuously strive to improve LockBot. Sadly, some commands did not share our vision and so we decided to remove them. Don't fret though, we are planning to bring some back!

## What makes you any different to another Anti Raid or Raid Prevention Discord Bot?

We aim to give you total control over your server, this is why we don't have any Auto Moderation features as of yet. You are enable to customize a few things within LockBot to best suite you. We are not looking for competition from other Discord Bots, LockBot is there in case you need to stop a load of alts joining the server or alts spamming every single channel.

## Is it LockBot, lockbot, Lockbot \(and so on\)?

Good question! It generally doesn't matter but here on the documentation, we try to keep it as LockBot.

## What is the bot prefix / Why is it not working?

The bot's prefix is **`.`** \(It has been for a while\). If the main prefix is still not working for you and it may have been changed but you don't know what it would be, tag the bot and it will show you your current server prefix.

**Can I change the prefix I don't like the default one?**

Yes - you can find out more below.

## How do I become staff?

We currently are not looking for staff members right now. However, we do have an opportunity to help us out in the discord server. Please DM mesub\#0556 for more information.

## Does Lock Bot actually prevent raids?

LockBot can be used as part of a server management kit to help prevent raids. This includes using [Discord's security verification levels](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/216679607-What-are-Verification-Levels-) as well as using another bot for verification. Depending on how many measures you have put in place, LockBot can be your second or third \(last\) form of defence if a raid occurs.
