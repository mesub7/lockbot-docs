# Link Lock

People posting links that you don't want in your server? Easy, just remove the privilege!

{% hint style="success" %}
**Format: \[prefix\]I-lock**

**User permissions required: Lock Bot Admin or Server Admin**

**Bot permissions required: Manage Messages** â€“ _It's advised that lock bot should have full server admin to carry out functions correctly._
{% endhint %}

This command, when enabled, will not allow anybody to post links \(discord links as well as other links\) to any channel that the bot can see. If a link has been posted then the bot will automatically remove it and post this message:

To disable this, simply run \[prefix\]l-unlock and it will disable it, allowing anybody to post links.

**Note:** Lock bot moderators and admins as well as users with administrator permissions will be able to bypass this lock.
