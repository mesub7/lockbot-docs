# Kick Lock

Expecting a large amount of people that you don't really want? Enabling kick lock will sort that issue for you.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Format: \[prefix\]k-lock**

**User permissions required: Lock Bot Admin or Server Admin**

**Bot permissions required: Kick Members -** _It's advised that lock bot has the administrator flag to carry out all functions correctly._
{% endhint %}

If the command has been activated successfully, it should kick any members that join the server while the command is active. A succession message will be sent to the logs \(if configured\) and to the channel that the command was run in.

Users that are affected by this will receive a DM from the bot informing them about this lock being enabled which was why they were kicked.
