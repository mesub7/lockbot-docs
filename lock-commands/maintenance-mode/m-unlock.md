# M-Unlock

To unlock your server, you will need to use m-unlock \(unless you want to do it all manually!\).

{% hint style="success" %}
**Format: \[Prefix\]m-unlock \(1, 2 or 3\)**

**User Perms Required: Lock Bot Admin, Server Admin**

**Bot Perms Required: Manage channels, Manage messages** â€“ _It's advised that lock bot should have full server admin to carry out functions correctly._
{% endhint %}

There are three different methods to use m-unlock; each is explained in its own tab.

**Please note that there is a limit of 45 channels due to the high resources this command uses. If you need to unlock more channels then please consider using the premium bot \(coming soon\).**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Method 1: Unlock all channels " %}
To unlock all channels, you would use the command `[prefix]m-unlock 1` which will then unlock all channels.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Method 2: Unlock all channels in a category" %}
Prerequisite: To ensure that this command works as intended, ensure that all channels in the category have their permissions synced.

To unlock all channels in a specific category, you would need to run this command `[prefix]m-unlock 2 (category name).`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Method 3: Unlock mentioned channel" %}
To utilise this command, simply run `[prefix]m-unlock 3 #channel.`

A space is needed to separate the channels, nothing else.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
