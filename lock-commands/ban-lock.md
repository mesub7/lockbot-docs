# Ban lock

Getting raided? Expecting unwelcome visitors to your server? Enabling ban lock will sort that issue out for you.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Format: \[prefix\]b-lock**

**User permissions required: Lock Bot Admin or Server Admin**

**Bot permissions required: Ban Members -** _It's advised that lock bot has the administrator flag to carry out all functions correctly._
{% endhint %}

If the command has been activated successfully, it should ban any members that join the server while the command is active. A succession message will be sent to the logs \(if configured\) and to the channel that the command was run in.

Users that are affected by this will receive a DM from the bot informing them about this lock being enabled which was why they were banned.
