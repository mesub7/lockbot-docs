# Invite Link Lock

Don't want people posting invite links to their Fortnite clan? We got you covered.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Format: \[prefix\]d-lock**

**User permissions required: Lock Bot Admin or Server Admin**

**Bot permissions required: Manage Messages** â€“ _It's advised that lock bot should have full server admin to carry out functions correctly._
{% endhint %}

This command has the exact same functionality as the link lock. The only difference is that it will only look for discord links. If it is triggered then this message will appear:

**Note:** Lock bot moderators and admins as well as users with administrator permissions will be able to bypass this lock.

To allow people to post invite links again, simply run \[prefix\]d-unlock.
