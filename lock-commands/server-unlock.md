# Server Unlock

Finally! It seems like those raiders have gone \(for now at least!\) and you need to open your server again; s-unlock should do the job.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Format: \[prefix\]s-unlock**

**User permissions required: LockBot Admin or Server Admin**

**Bot permissions required: Administrator** _\(Ban Members / Kick Members may work but is not supported\)_ 

_It's advised that LockBot should have the administrator permission to carry out functions correctly._
{% endhint %}

Upon running this command, the bot will send a succession message and send a message in the logs channel \(if configured, as shown in the screenshot below\). This command will disable **maintenance mode** meaning that members will be able to see channels again.
