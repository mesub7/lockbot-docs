# Lock Bot \| Version 2

{% hint style="danger" %}
**End of support**

**"**_The time has come to let you guys know and get this off my head, we will be phase out the lock bot network project ending officially on the 29th of October 2020 when the discord endpoints change to discord.com and intents are enforced. This has come for many reasons including time for the project._

_The bot will no longer receive updates but full support will be continued until this date, broken things will have to stay as they are for the time being. We discussed making open source but decided against it just due to the things that are linked with our servers and commands that are broken including the fact that it will need to be updated to discord js v12. I do hope that lock bot has inspired developers to take on projects in such an area._

_This is quite a stressful time for me so I do hope you respect our decision with this. Further info may be released closer to the time, until then we hope to keep, keeping your discord safe!_ "

## **Information:**

Lock bot as you know has been running for a while now; breaking records I never thought we would ever get to.  
It has occurred to us that some of the commands are now also quite old, outdated and are becoming quite hard to work on.  
During the summer and future months, I am trying rewrite lock bot and all of its code to make it more stable and useful to the community.

We would like your opinion on some of the current commands that may return but also new features that will make there way into lock bot. You can do this by joining our Community & Support Discord Server which has the invite link on the main site.
