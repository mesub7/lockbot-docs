## **Information:**

_"Hey guys! I'm Miguel, I'll be taking over the Development of Lock Bot. As you will be aware, Lock Bot has Been offline for an extended period of time._

_So, I'll be recoding Lock Bot to make it better \[than it was_ ðŸ˜‚_\] and less buggy! Development of Lock Bot will take a lot of time although \(fingers crossed\), I can publish the **beta** version of Lock Bot on the **1st January 2021**._

_We would like your opinion on some of the current commands that may return but also new features that will make their way into LockBot. You can do this by joining our Community & Support Discord Server which has the invite link_ [_here_](https://discord.gg/9t2csSh)_."_
