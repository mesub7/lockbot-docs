## **Information:**

  
Lock bot as you know has been running for a while now; breaking records I never thought we would ever get to.  
It has occurred to us that some of the commands are now also quite old, outdated and are becoming quite hard to work on.  
During the summer and future months I am trying rewrite lock bot and all of its code to make it more stable and useful to the community.

We would like your opinion on some of the current commands that may return but also new features that will make there way into lock bot. You can do this by joining our Community & Support Discord Server which has the invite link on the main site.
